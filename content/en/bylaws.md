Wizard Council:
A group of volunteers that sets direction and leads major projects or initiatives of the group. If they need resources to do something, they may work with the Finance Council to get them. It is open to anyone that wants to actively contribute to UX Wizards.

Finance Council:
A subset of the Wizard Council whose role is to make sure goals and projects of the Wizard Council are resourced properly (not including volunteers). This includes managing sponsorships and the budget. Members of the Finance Council should not have any conflicts of interest (i.e. lead other UX/UI groups or are a major sponsor themselves). Although transparency is important, the level of detail that is publicized need not go beyond the financial statements one would find in a typical annual report unless required.

Political Organizing:
While UX Wizards will not support political organizing, a subset of wizards may organize themselves outside of UX-Wizards if desired.

Harassment:
Harassment of any form shall not be tolerated. UX Wizards has a zero tolerance policy for harassment. Harassment includes unprofessional behavior, unsolicited ‘reaching out’ to other Wizards under the guise of networking, and any behavior that could make a fellow wizard in any way uncomfortable. Please stay professional. We meet for a positive experience and that involves being respectful of boundaries, and being respectful of your fellow Wizards. If you are unsure if what you are doing is considered appropriate, feel free to ask a member of the leadership council. We’ll definitely steer you in the right direction. It is the responsibility of every wizard to make sure that no wizards are ever made to feel uncomfortable while networking under and in our group. You will be banned. All Wizards are expected to comply with this policy.
If you notice harassment, please speak up and offending parties will be removed.

Use of Zoom
UX Wizards Zoom account shall be used for UX Wizards events and meetings. If for some reason there is a scheduling conflict we may use Google meet, but please do use UXW Zoom for Wizards-related activities.

Password Management
When organizing events, you may need access to certain services or resources. If that service or resource has administrative management capabilities (e.g. Meetup or YouTube), your login for that service or resource will be given the privileges that you need. If you require direct account credentials to that service or resource, you will be required to have a LastPass account and the credentials will be shared with your LastPass account. Any member of Wizard Council will be able to either give you the necessary administrative capabilities or share with you the necessary login credentials.
