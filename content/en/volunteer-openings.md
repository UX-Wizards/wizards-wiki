## Next Steps

**Did you find an interesting team / project to join?** \
👉🏼 Reach out to the designated person listed

**Do you have event / project ideas?** \
👉🏼 Reach out to E-board (Keri, Laura, Seiko or Kaisen)

**Want to get involved but nothing here speaks to you?** \
👉🏼 Ask yourself: **What is something I've wanted to do but would be more enjoyable with others?** For example, maybe you need help with interview practice and are interested in gathering others to join you. Or maybe you've always wanted to read a book but need the accountability of a book club. Maybe you just want to learn from others about their favorite UX techniques and would like to plan a themed discussion. If you want to do it, I'm sure someone else does too. Just let us know!
