Want to help organise our next remote ux design challenge? We‚Äôve run 5 of these in the past, they‚Äôve always been really popular and fun with wizards and typically ‚Äòsell out‚Äô within an hour of being announced. For this project, we‚Äôre looking to see if we can streamline our event and bump it up from a 25 person event to potentially a 60 person event, making it our largest hackathon yet!

### Event: Remote UX Challenge

**Looking for:** Lead and organizers \
**Contact:** Keri, Seiko, or Kaisen

The Remote UX Challenge (RUXC) is a virtual Design Jam / Hackathon and one of our most popular and high-impact events. We are open to however you want to run it - in the past it has been done as a week-long challenge or over the course of a weekend. We will help you form your organizing team and can let you know what has been done previously. 

We hear most of the work is setting it up but then during the event it's smooth sailing for the organizers (less so for the participants üòâ), and then you can say you've run your own hackathon! We should also be able to set you up with Adobe prizes (contingent on sponsor approval).

## Next Steps

### Did you find an interesting team / project to join?

Please reach out to the designated person listed.

### Do you have event / project ideas?

**If it's a public event** or project that might be posted on MeetUp, please reach out to E-board (Keri, Laura, Seiko or Kaisen).

**If it's an internal event** just for Wizards already in our Slack then just let us know what you need! You can also ask in the Slack #events channel if other Wizards would be interested. Don't feel like you need to do it alone either; you can always ask if anyone would be willing to help organize whatever you have in mind. We're all friendly here!

### Want to get involved but nothing here speaks to you?

Ask yourself: **What is something I've wanted to do but would be more enjoyable with others?** 

For example, maybe you need help with interview practice and are interested in gathering others to join you. Or maybe you've always wanted to read a book but need the accountability of a book club. Maybe you just want to learn from others about their favorite UX techniques and would like to plan a themed discussion. If you want to do it, I'm sure someone else does too. Just let us know!
