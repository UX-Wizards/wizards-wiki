Looking to help out UX Wizards in some way? If you're don't have something yet in mind, take a look at the listings below!

### Event: UX Chicken

**Looking for:** Co-host and/or Planner \
**Contact:** Keri, Laura, or Kaisen

We'd like to do another UX Chicken - basically a lighthearted event where we literally get chicken and hang out together in-person or virtually (up to you) and maybe... watching a movie? chatting? Some kind of activity! We need some help picking out a movie or Zoom-friendly activity and figuring out logistics.

### Event: UX Mixer Trivia

**Due Date:** Thursday, May 27 \
**Looking for:** Trivia Question Maker, Presentation Slides Maker, and/or 2 Co-Hosts \
**Contact:** Keri Fullwood

Our next mixer is a trivia night and we need help coming up with 12 questions / answers and co-hosts for during the event to help shuffle people in and out of Breakout Rooms.

### Admin: Slack Emote Adding

**Looking for:** 1-2 people \
**Contact:** Laura Williams

Need someone to add fun emotes to our Slack! Iâ€™d give you admin privileges and you can go at it. Would be discussing if we need to drop any or update some.

### Event: Book Club

**Looking for:** Lead and organizers \
**Contact:** Laura, Keri, Seiko, or Kaisen

Book Club needs someone to spearhead it! We are up for however you'd like to run it.

### Project: Podcast Art Designer

**Looking for:** 1-2 people \
**Contact:** Keri Fullwood

Weâ€™d like to have a designer on board to help us create some original art for each episode of our podcast!

### Event: Remote UX Challenge

**Looking for:** Lead and organizers \
**Contact:** Keri, Seiko, or Kaisen

The Remote UX Challenge (RUXC) is a virtual Design Jam / Hackathon and one of our most popular and high-impact events. We are open to however you want to run it - in the past it has been done as a week-long challenge or over the course of a weekend. We will help you form your organizing team and can let you know what has been done previously. 

We hear most of the work is setting it up but then during the event it's smooth sailing for the organizers (less so for the participants ðŸ˜‰), and then you can say you've run your own hackathon! We should also be able to set you up with Adobe prizes (based on sponsor approval).

## Next Steps

#### Did you find an interesting team / project to join?**

Please reach out to the designated person listed.

#### Do you have event / project ideas?

**If it's a public event** or project that might be posted on MeetUp, please reach out to E-board (Keri, Laura, Seiko or Kaisen).

**If it's an internal event** just for Wizards already in our Slack, you may feel free to ask if other Wizards would be interested by posting in the Slack #events channel. Don't feel like you need to do it alone either; you can always ask if anyone would be willing to help organize whatever you have in mind. We're all friendly here!

#### Want to get involved but nothing here speaks to you?

Ask yourself: **What is something I've wanted to do but would be more enjoyable with others?** 

For example, maybe you need help with interview practice and are interested in gathering others to join you. Or maybe you've always wanted to read a book but need the accountability of a book club. Maybe you just want to learn from others about their favorite UX techniques and would like to plan a themed discussion. If you want to do it, I'm sure someone else does too. Just let us know!
