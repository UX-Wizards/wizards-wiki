**UX Wizards** is a community of passionate, supportive learners and UX enthusiasts.

Together we host a variety of events each month that include casual hangouts, game nights, and learning events. You can find us active on the UX Wizards [MeetUp group](https://www.meetup.com/UX-WIZARDS), our dedicated Slack, and our hangout [Discord](http://uxwizards.org/discord).

Membership is completely free! We welcome all that want to participate and join with the intention of making real connections, a willingness to support others, and an interest in learning together.
