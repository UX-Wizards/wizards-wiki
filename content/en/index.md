## Hello and welcome to UX Wizards!

### What does UX Wizards do? 👩‍💻
The community hosts several events every month that include casual hangouts, games, trivia and learning events. We also are active in and maintain a UX Wizards Slack and Discord. UX Wizards is run by members just like you, so please reach out to anyone on our eBoard if you have an idea you’d like to help make into reality. For a full list of Volunteers and teams, please take a look at our Wizard Volunteers list.

### Can I invite friends to the UX Wizards Slack? 🎟️
While the easy answer is “yes!”, we highly encourage everyone to attend at least one Zoom (or in-person) meeting before they join our Slack. We ask this of members so that they may get an idea of what we are about and feel comfortable taking an active part in our supportive community.. In short, it’s ok to forward the details, but please encourage your friend to join us for a public event on Meetup so that we may give them a proper welcome.

### How do I attend UX Wizard events? 🏟️
We have many events that we put on throughout the year. Some of the highlights include a Halloween party, game nights and portfolio reviews. Here’s how you can find out what’s going on at any time, and at your convenience: 
* UX Wizards on Meetup: Feel free to join us at any of our events on meetup!
* UX Wizards Events Calendar: If you’re feeling fancy, and want to also see a few secret events, you can also subscribe to UX Wizards Events Calendar. Also, check out our web calendar link for viewing in-browser.

### How do I connect with UX Wizards? 🐬
You can follow us on Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin, Spotify and YouTube. You can also visit the UXW website.

### How do I suggest events? Who do I speak to if I have an idea? 💡
If you are interested in sharing an idea or suggesting an event please:
Submit it to the following GOOGLE FORM. This will track it and make it available to volunteers who might want to work with you on it.
Post it in #suggestion-box so people can learn about it immediately. It is also helpful to state whether you are interested in being the lead organizer for it, or whether it’s just a suggestion.
Bring it up at the weekly office hours that occurs at 7:30PM PST on Thursdays.

### How do I help UX Wizards? 💪
We are always looking for help! However, because we want everyone involved to have the best experience possible (we are UX designers and enthusiasts, after all) we would encourage you to look out for vacancies as we post them!

In the meantime please feel free to chat in our Slack. We also have Office Hours every Thursday at 7:30pm where you are welcome to come chat about any ideas you may have or how the group could be improved. Check our UX events calendar for details.

### How do I volunteer with UX Wizards? 🔨 
If you are interested in joining one of our teams, keep an eye out for vacancies posted every now and then (usually quarterly!). Feel free to get to know us in Slack until then!

We also encourage members to start their own initiatives. Let E-board know so  we may be able to help you logistically (e.g. setup Zoom, Meetup, etc), as well as help with finding team members and piloting the event.

Our Merch Team does have an Merch Team Interest Form, which you are welcome to fill out at any time!
