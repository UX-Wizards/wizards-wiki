### What does UX Wizards do? 👩‍💻

The community hosts several events every month that include casual hangouts, games, trivia and learning events. We also are active in and maintain a UX Wizards Slack and Discord. UX Wizards is run by members just like you, so please reach out to anyone on our eBoard if you have an idea you’d like to help make into reality. For a full list of Volunteers and teams, please take a look at our Wizard Volunteers list.

### Can I invite friends to the UX Wizards Slack? 🎟️

While the easy answer is “yes!”, we highly encourage everyone to attend at least one Zoom (or in-person) meeting before they join our Slack. We ask this of members so that they may get an idea of what we are about and feel comfortable taking an active part in our supportive community.. In short, it’s ok to forward the details, but please encourage your friend to join us for a public event on Meetup so that we may give them a proper welcome.

### How do I attend UX Wizard events? 🏟️

We have many events that we put on throughout the year. Some of the highlights include a Halloween party, game nights and portfolio reviews. Here’s how you can find out what’s going on at any time, and at your convenience:

- UX Wizards on Meetup: Feel free to join us at any of our events on meetup!
- UX Wizards Events Calendar: If you’re feeling fancy, and want to also see a few secret events, you can also subscribe to UX Wizards Events Calendar. Also, check out our web calendar link for viewing in-browser.

### How do I connect with UX Wizards? 🐬

You can follow us on Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin, Spotify and YouTube. You can also visit the UXW website.

### How do I suggest events? Who do I speak to if I have an idea? 💡

If you are interested in sharing an idea or suggesting an event please:
Submit it to the following GOOGLE FORM. This will track it and make it available to volunteers who might want to work with you on it.
Post it in #suggestion-box so people can learn about it immediately. It is also helpful to state whether you are interested in being the lead organizer for it, or whether it’s just a suggestion.
Bring it up at the weekly office hours that occurs at 7:30PM PST on Thursdays.

### How do I help UX Wizards? 💪

We are always looking for help! However, because we want everyone involved to have the best experience possible (we are UX designers and enthusiasts, after all) we would encourage you to look out for vacancies as we post them!

In the meantime please feel free to chat in our Slack. We also have Office Hours every Thursday at 7:30pm where you are welcome to come chat about any ideas you may have or how the group could be improved. Check our UX events calendar for details.

### How do I volunteer with UX Wizards? 🔨

If you are interested in joining one of our teams, keep an eye out for vacancies posted every now and then (usually quarterly!). Feel free to get to know us in Slack until then!

We also encourage members to start their own initiatives. Let E-board know so we may be able to help you logistically (e.g. setup Zoom, Meetup, etc), as well as help with finding team members and piloting the event.

Our Merch Team does have an Merch Team Interest Form, which you are welcome to fill out at any time!

## Event/Project Questions

When it comes to 

### Can I host an event? 
Yes, please do! We want everyone to get out of this group what they want out of it and encourage everyone to treat it as their own personal group of UX friends.

### What if my event is last minute?
We don't mind; most of our early events were last minute plans. We all gotta start somewhere!

### What if I have to cancel my event?
Totally okay! You do you. 😎 We just ask you let people know and follow up - be sure to cancel the event in the calendar/MeetUp if applicable and announce it in the #events channel.

## What options should I consider when planning my event?


### Can I announce my event in the Slack?
We recommend it! It's good to tell people in the #events channel

### Can I promote my UXW event online?
Yes! It's your event so it is up to you. If it's a public event (may be posted on MeetUp) then we can also have our Content Design Team post it on our UXW socials if given enough notice. [View our advertising request form]

### Can I promote another UXW event online?
If it is a public MeetUp event: Yes, everyone is welcome to join and take part in our events, even if they don't do UX.

If it is a Slack-only event: Please ask the host if they are okay with promoting it outside of the Slack.

### Can I use UXW's Zoom for my event?
Anyone can use our Zoom for UXW events, subject to scheduling. Events already in the UX Leadership calendar take precedence and it is first-come first-served. We ask that you do not use the group's Zoom for personal meetings.

### Can I form a team for my event?
Yes, please feel free to ask people if they'd like to help out! You can always post in the Slack channel #events or #volunteer.

### Can I invite my friends to an event?
If it is a public MeetUp event: Yes, everyone is welcome to join and take part in our events, even if they don't do UX.

If it is a Slack-only event: Please ask the host before inviting others. 

### Why are there public events and private events?
Event size is subject to the host's preferences.

Reasons they may want it Slack-only: If they want to keep the attendees small, maybe they are nervous about their first time hosting, if they just want to see familiar faces, if they want to keep the event more intimate.

### How do I know if an event is public (MeetUp or other) or private (Slack-only)?
The easiest way to check would be to see if our MeetUp account has the event listed online. You may also ask the host directly.
