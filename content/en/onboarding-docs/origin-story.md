HELLO! Cool! You wanted to learn more! :) 

Our group formed in 2018 as an in-person meetup group based in Sunnyvale, California. We actually used to meet in the lobby of the combination Starbucks/lobby Santa Clara Hyatt, which was wonderfully confusing for new members. When we outgrew our original space, we started finding bigger venues including TAP’T in Sunnyvale.

We host a ton of events and we enjoy the in person aspect of our community. We had always planned on doing some form of online event, but in 2020 when the pandemic hit, we flipped the switch to go completely online, at least for the time being!

We’ve hosted over 250 in-person and virtual ‘live’ events, which include co-working sessions, book clubs, mixers, portfolio reviews and speaking events.


Who is Gandalf?
Gandalf Winterwhisk is our cheerful (and made up) mascot. The wizard in the picture below is actually Merlin (from The Sword in the Stone) but sort of helps explain the ‘light hearted, mystical wizard’ persona that we’ve crafted, and refer to as ‘Gandalf.’


Fun fact, his last name “Winterwhisk” came from a Wizard name generator online. Sometimes we’ll refer to “Gandalf’s Calendar” which can be a bit confusing, but this usually just means UX Wizards Calendar. UX Wizards is also sometimes abbreviated as “UXW” or “Wizards.” While our logo used to feature ‘Gandalf’ it has been simplified to just be his hat.
