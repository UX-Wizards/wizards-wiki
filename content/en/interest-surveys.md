**Web Design Team** hope to help make UX Wizards better by improving the groups web presence and documentation. This is a great team for people interested in learning web stuff or helping guide those that want to learn.

Past projects include: [UXW Design System](https://designsystem.uxwizards.org/#/introduction) and the Netlify Wiki you're looking at. ;)

## Merch Team

[Merch Team Interest Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVksUmf3GseBOtnOU2f_HhumVNzDhnUMYNRhxgD5UQy7TECw/viewform)\
*Lead: Joanne Arboleda*

**Merch Design Team** runs creative passion projects that create items or swag to offer Wizards. They are often art / design focused and can be held either exclusively for Merch members to work on, or held more like an event with a call-to-action for any Wizards that are interested in creating. This is a great team for people interested in creating pretty things~

Past projects include: a digital cookbook with recipes from Wizards, vinyl UXW stickers to be sold on Ko-Fi, and digital holiday cards.
