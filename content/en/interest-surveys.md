[Merch Team Interest Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVksUmf3GseBOtnOU2f_HhumVNzDhnUMYNRhxgD5UQy7TECw/viewform)\
*Lead: Joanne Arboleda*

> **Merch Design Team** runs creative passion projects that create items or swag to offer Wizards. They are often art / design focused and can be held either exclusively for Merch members to work on, or held more like an event with a call-to-action for any Wizards that are interested in creating. This is a great team for people interested in creating pretty things~
>
> Past projects include: a digital cookbook with recipes from Wizards, vinyl UXW stickers to be sold on Ko-Fi, and digital holiday cards.
