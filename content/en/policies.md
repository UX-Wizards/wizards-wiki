WIP ( i took some info from some fb groups that I wanna copy and edit)

❣️ Who We Are
We urge our members to not assume the pronouns of others. While many of our members use she/her, for example, some use they/them. Remember not to make assumptions about people’s gender based on their photos or names they use on their online profiles.

We are for UX Enthusiasts
Whether you have a job in tech, are seeking a job in tech, or have a job in tech that is not typically thought of as "technical" (such as marketing, business development, design, UX/UI, research, etc.), you are welcome here. This group is for you. Please be welcoming of all who join.

❣️ This Is A Safe Space.
We encourage discussion of sensitive and difficult topics so that we can support each other, help each other find solutions, and problem solve together. Due to the sensitive nature of many of these discussions, please keep what is said in these spaces - whether online or in person - confidential unless you receive permission otherwise. Be especially cognizant to avoid sharing identifying information, and remember that anything you do share is seen by thousands of people. Always ask the original poster or speaker if they would feel comfortable having their post or experience shared.

❣️ Zero Tolerance For Hateful Messages & Actions.
Each of our members plays a role in establishing and promoting a positive, inclusive, and encouraging community. Discussions, posts, actions, or comments that promote hatred of any kind - including, but not limited to, racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, biphobia, queerphobia, ableism, and ageism - are not acceptable in Tech Ladies spaces and may result in you being removed from online or in-person spaces.

❣️ Trust Intent, Name Impact.
Trust that everyone in this group has each other's best interests at heart; but if someone says something incorrect or hurtful, name what impact that has. Report hateful or violent posts, comments, discussions, or actions to admin. See more details on that process below.

❣️ Make Space, Take Space.
Speak up and have your voice heard, but also be cognizant of how much space you're occupying and take a step back when needed. Let people of different backgrounds tell their stories and experiences. We have a lot to learn from each other!

❣️ Value Each Other!
Many members of this community spend their precious and valuable time to give each other guidance, advice, introductions, etc. If someone does this for you, acknowledge their comments, take time to write back thank you to their private messages, and pay it forward when you can.

❣️ Policies for Online Tech Ladies Spaces
To preserve positivity and inclusivity, our online spaces are moderated. All posts will be approved before being available to the group. See all of our guidelines in our pinned Facebook post.

this is a pitch free space
being a member here means you're here to engage in thoughtful conversations. no link threads, self-promotion, or spam. posts that are low-key pitching will not be allowed and will be deelted.

we're a dafe/inclusive space
our group is made up of a variety of backgroudna dn all are heard and valued.

no sharing out - attribution
don't share out potentially sensistive content without permission. what's shared in the community stays in the community.

❣️ As a reminder, while we have several admins for our Tech Ladies online spaces, we can't read every exchange. If you see anything that you believe breaks our community guidelines, please reach out to help@hiretechladies.com with screenshots of the post and a link to the post or comments.

❣️ We take every report of hatred, violence, and harassment seriously and we prioritize working with those affected to determine what the next steps should be. If someone is found to have broken the Tech Ladies code of conduct, they will be removed from the group.

❣️ If a member promotes violence or hatred, an admin will warn them about their behavior. Ideally, we want that person to recognize the impact of their actions and follow that up with clear behavioral changes. If there is a second strike, we will remove that person from our community. Certain egregious violations - such as threatening harm toward another member or harassing another member - may result in removal without a warning. The admins reserve the right to make that judgement without discussion if needed.

❣️ As explained in more detail in our Facebook posts guidelines, members use the #DISCUSS tag to share interesting articles related to tech. This tag underscores the value we hold toward thoughtful discussions. We also recognize that we will often disagree.

❣️ Disagreements turn into violations of our code of conduct when they target a member or members for their viewpoints or identity or encourage discrimination, harassment, or other forms of violence. When we are investigating a complaint, we will close commenting on the thread to assess the safety for all members. See Less

Wizard Council:
A group of volunteers that sets direction and leads major projects or initiatives of the group. If they need resources to do something, they may work with the Finance Council to get them. It is open to anyone that wants to actively contribute to UX Wizards.

Finance Council:
A subset of the Wizard Council whose role is to make sure goals and projects of the Wizard Council are resourced properly (not including volunteers). This includes managing sponsorships and the budget. Members of the Finance Council should not have any conflicts of interest (i.e. lead other UX/UI groups or are a major sponsor themselves). Although transparency is important, the level of detail that is publicized need not go beyond the financial statements one would find in a typical annual report unless required.

Political Organizing:
While UX Wizards will not support political organizing, a subset of wizards may organize themselves outside of UX-Wizards if desired.

Harassment:
Harassment of any form shall not be tolerated. UX Wizards has a zero tolerance policy for harassment. Harassment includes unprofessional behavior, unsolicited ‘reaching out’ to other Wizards under the guise of networking, and any behavior that could make a fellow wizard in any way uncomfortable. Please stay professional. We meet for a positive experience and that involves being respectful of boundaries, and being respectful of your fellow Wizards. If you are unsure if what you are doing is considered appropriate, feel free to ask a member of the leadership council. We’ll definitely steer you in the right direction. It is the responsibility of every wizard to make sure that no wizards are ever made to feel uncomfortable while networking under and in our group. You will be banned. All Wizards are expected to comply with this policy.
If you notice harassment, please speak up and offending parties will be removed.

Use of Zoom
UX Wizards Zoom account shall be used for UX Wizards events and meetings. If for some reason there is a scheduling conflict we may use Google meet, but please do use UXW Zoom for Wizards-related activities.

Password Management
When organizing events, you may need access to certain services or resources. If that service or resource has administrative management capabilities (e.g. Meetup or YouTube), your login for that service or resource will be given the privileges that you need. If you require direct account credentials to that service or resource, you will be required to have a LastPass account and the credentials will be shared with your LastPass account. Any member of Wizard Council will be able to either give you the necessary administrative capabilities or share with you the necessary login credentials.
